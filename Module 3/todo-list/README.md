  ## Description

  A simple React to do list application which allows you to add and delete to-dos to your list as well as mark tasks as completed when you have accomplished them.

  ## Installation

  First you will need to clone the repository

  `` git clone git@github.com:bjaegerthomas/Technical-Assessment.git ``

  In vscode you will want to navigate to the Module 3 folder.

  Open an integrated terminal in VS Code from the 3rd module folder.

  - Next you will type `` npm install `` and hit return.
