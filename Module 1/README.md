  ## Description
  A simple splash page for a fictional business. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript I have designed a very barebones webpage to illustrate my understanding of coding concepets for the languages mentioned above.

  ## Installation
  First you will need to clone the repository

  `` git clone git@github.com:bjaegerthomas/Technical-Assessment.git ``

  From here you can view the webpage by right clicking on the html file in vscode and selecting "open in default browser."

  I've included a screenshot here:
